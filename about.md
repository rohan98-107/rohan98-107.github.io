I am a graduate student at the University of Washington, currently enrolled in the Applied Math Department. My coursework and research interests span "industrial mathematics" i.e. using quantitative methodologies to tackle complex people-centric modeling problems. I am fortunate to be advised by [Zelda Zabinsky](http://faculty.washington.edu/zelda/), on a thesis project in global simulation optimization.

### Education

**M.S. - Applied Mathematics, University of Washington**

*2020 - Current*

**B.A. - Mathematics, Rutgers University**

*2016 - 2020*


### Research Experience

**Stochastic Optimization with Guided restarts via a modified Hesitant Adaptive Search Process**

*University of Washington - Dept. of Industrial Engineering*

*Advised by: Zelda Zabinsky*

*In Progress*

**Computational Geometric Image Processing Algorithms**

*Rutgers University - Dept. of Computer Science*

*Advised by: Bahman Kalantari*

*2019-2020*

  * Developed three novel algorithms that use a variety of geometric techniques to pre-process images for specific learning problems
  * Produced and maintained several gigabytes of numerical and graphical results
  * Substantiated theoretical guarantees for the complexity of these algorithms
  * Used both spatial properties and heuristics to discuss the “convergence” of an image
  * Exploited properties of convex hulls and projective spaces to represent pixel information mathematically

**Polynomiographic Image Compression**

*Rutgers University - Aresty Research Center*

*Advised by: Bahman Kalantari*

*2018-2019*

  * Explored elementary complex analysis and its uses in numerical root-finding methods
  * Explored the basics of dynamical systems and their relationship to root-finding
  * Attended workshops on how to read, write and understand academic papers
  * Gave talks amongst our different research groups to improve presentation skills
  * Proposed, implemented and presented a method for compressing an image into a system of polynomials based on the depth, sizes and orientations of the images’ Newton’s basins

### Internships

**Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE)**

*Data Analyst Intern*

*6/2019-8/2019*

  * Collaborated with various teams to design a new AWS application architecture with refined ETL/analytic processes
  * Incorporated a pairwise-graph similarity index algorithm for author disambiguation into our existing architecture
  * Engineered Oozie workflows and Spark jobs on AWS Glue via Lambda functions using a Python API
  * Migrated a terabyte of legacy production data from HDFS to Amazon S3, EMR and Redshift  
  * Optimized search functionality on IEEE Xplore website via web-crawlers and historic content-based .json data
  * Generated Tableau dashboards of IEEE Xplore usage data to assist business units in detecting fraudulent usage

**DistroScale, Inc.**	 	 	 

*Software Engineering Intern*

*06/18 – 08/18*

  * Utilized a naive logistic regression algorithm to classify anonymous IP server requests
  * Regularly communicated with teams overseas via data reports generated by SQL queries in the Hadoop platform  
  * Performed root-cause analyses to assist in managing web traffic
  * Deployed MapReduce to detect problematic inputs to server-side code
  * Summarized data collected from debugging applications in a presentation supplemented by D3 visualizations
