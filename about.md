I am a graduate student at Arizona State University. My advisor is Professor Angelia Nedich. I have advanced training in optimization, statistics and computational mathematics and currently study the existence of solutions to nonconvex and semialgebraic optimization problems. I have recently become interested in variational problems and their applications in behavioral science.
