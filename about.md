I am a graduate student at the University of Washington, currently enrolled in the Applied Math Department. My coursework and research interests span "industrial mathematics" i.e. using quantitative methodologies to tackle complex people-centric modeling problems. I am fortunate to be advised by [Zelda Zabinsky] (http://faculty.washington.edu/zelda/), on a thesis project in global simulation optimization.

### Education

* M.S. - Applied Mathematics, University of Washington
  * 2020 - Current

* B.A. - Mathematics, Rutgers University
  * 2016 - 2020

### Research Experience

* Stochastic Optimization with Guided restarts via a modified Hesitant Adaptive Search Process
  * *University of Washington - Dept. of Industrial Engineering*
  * *Advised by: Zelda Zabinsky*
  * *In Progress*

* Computational Geometric Image Processing Algorithms
  * *Rutgers University - Dept. of Computer Science*
  * *Advised by: Bahman Kalantari*
  * Developed three novel algorithms that use a variety of geometric techniques to pre- process images for specific learning problems
  * Produced and maintained several gigabytes of numerical and graphical results
  * Substantiated theoretical guarantees for the complexity of these algorithms
  * Used both spatial properties and heuristics to discuss the “convergence” of an image
  * Exploited properties of convex hulls and projective spaces to represent pixel information mathematically

* Polynomiographic Image Compression
  * *Rutgers University - Aresty Research Center*
  * *Advised by: Bahman Kalantari*
  * Explored elementary complex analysis and its uses in numerical root-finding methods
  * Explored the basics of dynamical systems and their relationship to root-finding
  * Attended workshops on how to read, write and understand academic papers
  * Gave talks amongst our different research groups to improve presentation skills
  * Proposed, implemented and presented a method for compressing an image into a system of polynomials based on the depth, sizes and orientations of the images’ Newton’s basins
