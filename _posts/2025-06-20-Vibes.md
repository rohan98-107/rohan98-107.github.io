# How to model "vibes" or "gut-intuition"

I ran into a problem with my preference trajectory modeling. The standard approach extracts preference ratings from LLM responses and treats those as the final preference vector. But this misses something crucial about how humans actually make decisions.

Think about dating. You meet someone who checks 8/10 boxes on your list - smart, attractive, stable job, shared interests. Then you meet someone who only checks 6/10 boxes, but there's something about them that just clicks. Most people pick the 6-box person. And they're right to.

The issue is that preference isn't just conscious utility calculation. There's a hidden "vibe" component that influences choices in predictable ways.

## The Dual-System Approach

Kahneman's research [1] shows decision-making involves two systems: deliberative analysis (System 2) and intuitive reactions (System 1). Current preference modeling only captures System 2. But System 1 is constantly generating gut reactions based on aesthetics, familiarity, and processing ease.

Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis [2] suggests these "gut feelings" aren't random - they're rapid integration of complex information from past experiences. When something "feels right," your brain is processing real signal that conscious analysis misses.

Processing fluency research [3] adds that people prefer options that are closer to what they've seen before. Familiar brands, appealing aesthetics, and clear choices get preference boosts independent of objective attributes.

## Mathematical Implementation

So I'm decomposing preference into explicit + vibe components:

$$ Preference = RatingVector + f(Vibes; RatingVector)$$
So we take the explicit rating that the LLM provides based on our prompting experiment and add vibes in an interesting way. But all humans don't place the same weighting on vibes. Some are closer to true rational while others heavily rely on instinct and intuition. So my idea was to weight the terms randomly for each experimental set with uniformly random polynomial coefficients. The function $f$ , to keep things simple, is quadratic in the $Vibes$ and $RatingVector$ terms. 

The vibe component comes from extracting linguistic markers from LLM responses:

- **Aesthetic language:** "sleek," "premium," "professional looking"
- **Familiarity cues:** "reminds me of," "brand I know," "similar to"
- **Processing fluency:** Decision confidence and ease indicators
- **Emotional language:** "feels right," "gut reaction," "speaks to me"
## Why This Improves Trajectory Modeling

Humans shift between analytical and intuitive processing depending on the scenario. By tracking both explicit preferences and vibe components separately, you can map when people rely on System 1 vs System 2 thinking. This gives you richer trajectory data that actually reflects how preference formation works psychologically.

The goal isn't perfect rationality - it's systematic modeling of human-like decision patterns, including the ways we deviate from pure utility maximization.
