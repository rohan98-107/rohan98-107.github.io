title: What is OR?
katex: True
---

I think it's only right that my first post answer this question. As an OR newbie, I posed this very question to a professor at Carnegie Mellon who I happened to know through a mutual connection. Months later, while talking to a grad student studying particle physics, I asked "what is particle physics?" Interestingly, their answers started off similarly: "It's a really broad field, but to me..."

In general, I think academics have difficulty defining their fields. This is probably because there are so many aspects to <*insert field name here*>, that it becomes cumbersome to condense years of research and education down to a singularly accepted definition. That being said, I will attempt to do so here.

Operations Research is the mathematics of individual or institutional decision-making. Years ago, what I now consider to be OR, I used to call "Applied Mathematics". But Applied Mathematics can mean almost anything in engineering or the sciences. OR, while still broad, doesn't generally include natural phenomena - although there can still be overlap (e.g. environmental engineering can require solving optimization problems that include physical constraints). My thoughts on the relationship between Operations Research and Applied Mathematics are summarized in the diagram below:

Another term closely related to OR is **industrial mathematics**. I will probably use this term a lot simply because I think it's more descriptive and still amenable to the layman. Industrial applications of mathematics fall roughly under two categories: (1) maximizing/minimizing efficiency/risk of a particular business decision, or (2) predicting the potential outcomes of a business decision. In addressing these questions, one will undoubtedly turn to **optimization**, **probability** or a combination of both.

The theory and application of mathematical methods in optimization and/or probability *in the context of decisions that affect or are effected by humans* is what I consider to encompass the field of operations research.
