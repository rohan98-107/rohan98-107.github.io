title: What is OR?
katex: True
---

I think it's only right that my first post answer this question. As an OR newbie, I posed this very question to a professor at Carnegie Mellon who I happened to know through a mutual connection. Months later, while talking to a grad student studying particle physics, I asked "what is particle physics?" Interestingly, their answers begun with the same few words: "It's a really broad field, but..."

In general, I think academics have difficulty defining their fields. This is probably because there are so many aspects to <*insert field name here*>, that it becomes difficult to condense it all down to a singularly accepted definition. That being said, I will attempt to do so here.

Operations Research is the mathematics of decision-making. Years ago, what I know consider to be OR I used to call "Applied Mathematics". But Applied Mathematics is far too broad to describe OR. Applied Mathematics routinely emphasizes physical applications and computational sciences; and while true that these can significantly overlap with OR, I find it helpful to distinguish the two. In fact, I've included a nice image below which goes to show how inter-related mathematical science and engineering can be:

Another definition I like is **industrial mathematics**. I will probably use this term a lot simply because I think it's much more amenable to the layman. Industrial applications of mathematics routinely fall under two categories: (1) maximizing/minimizing efficiency/risk of a particular business decision, or (2) predicting the potential outcomes of a business decision. In addressing these questions, one will undoubtedly turn to **optimization**, **probability** or a combination of both.

The theory and application of optimization and probability *in the context of decisions that affect or are effected by humans* is what I consider to encompass the field of operations research.
