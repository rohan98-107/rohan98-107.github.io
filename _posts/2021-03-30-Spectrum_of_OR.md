title: The "Timeline" of Modern OR
katex: True
---

Stemming from military applications like transportive resource allocation and eventually pivoting its way into modern telecommunications/finance, the history of OR is intriguing to say the least. It has, without question, managed to make its substantive mark on nearly every "revolution" we have had in the past 100 years (including the great toilet paper uprising of 2020 - where logistical distribution challenges were rampant amongst consumers). Unfortunately for all you history buffs, this post is not exactly a standard *timeline* but is rather an interesting classification system of both subfields and practioners within OR that I have developed through numerous inspired conversations.

The reason I dubbed this classifier as a "timeline" is that **time** is the variable of separation! In particular, I hypothesize the different so-called "categories" of applied optimization can be placed next to one another on a time-scale. To further explore this idea, let us consider the following optimization taxonomy (taken from [here](https://neos-guide.org/content/optimization-taxonomy)):

Mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) often deal with large-scale games or variational inequalities which arise frequently in economics. These applications are generally "long-term" in the sense that markets/regimes with many dynamic interactions stabilize over years, sometimes decades. On the flip-side, techniques from optimal control or stochastic optimization are more prevalent in solving short-term or *real-time* problems. Optimizing a manufacturing process may fall somewhere in the middle of this "timeline". Some further examples are shown in this graphic:

Some disclaimers: (1) all of the fields listed above are extremely multi-faceted and by no means is this timeline attempting to diminish the tremendous amount of depth there is to any of these topics. (2) This time-scale is clearly not linear. Automatic control problems typically span the milliseconds-seconds range while sustainability problems can span several decades.

There is one other reason for my making this timeline. As a graduate student looking for advice, I found it difficult to find "operations researchers". What eventually helped me is the realization that finding OR research(ers) simply meant looking up and down this imaginary timeline. In particular, I found that electrical engineers and computer scientists were more likely to found on the "shorter" end of the timeline while economists were more likely to be found on the "farther" end. Everything in between was a likely mix of Industrial Engineers, Financial Mathematicans and others.

Once again, this may seem restrictive and, frankly, insulting to some. But as someone who is passionate about OR and wants others to share that passion, we are sometimes forced to distill intricacies down to crude, straight-forward separations. That is exactly what this timeline seeks to do and I sincerely hope it assists anyone who thinks they might be interested and wants to learn more.

~Happy optimizing!
