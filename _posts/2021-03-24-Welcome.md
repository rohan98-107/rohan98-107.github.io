Hello! Welcome to $$RO\displaystyle \int OR$$, a blog I created to share my passion for operations research with the ever-growing number of STEM enthusaists.

Why do my self-proclaimed expert opinions and posts warrant reading? Great question, they don't! There are several prolific Operations Research bloggers out there that this blog is very much inspired by. Some of my favorites include [Prof. Laura Albert's](https://punkrockor.com/), [Prof. Mike Trick's](https://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/blog/) and [Yet Another Math Programming Consultant's](http://yetanothermathprogrammingconsultant.blogspot.com/).

My super-secret mastermind plan is to use this blog as a means to brainwashing you into believing that operations research deserves just as much credit, if not more, than any of our favorite buzzwords (I'm looking at you *machine learning*). If I fail...well, at least I'd be convincing myself. I hope you all enjoy reading my future works and plethora of dorky jokes!
