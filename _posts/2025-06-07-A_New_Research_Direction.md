Traditional optimization assumes well-defined objective functions and consistent preferences. Human behavior systematically violates these assumptions in fascinating ways. Rather than treating this as noise to be eliminated, I'm developing mathematical frameworks that embrace and model the "irrationality" directly.

This blog documents my journey into computational behavioral science - using cutting-edge tools (LLM prompt engineering, quantum computing and advanced optimization) to understand the mathematical structure underlying human decision-making. Think of it as applied mathematics meeting psychology, with a healthy dose of experimental computer science.

## The Research Program: Optimizing Human Behavior

I'm launching a systematic investigation into different aspects of human cognitive "mistakes" that turn out to have deep mathematical structure:

**Current Investigation: The Mathematics of Preference**

From a psychological perspective, preferences aren't fixed attributes we possessâ€”they're dynamic constructions that emerge from cognitive architecture interacting with environmental framing. The mathematical challenge: how do we model systems where the optimization target itself is unstable and context-dependent?

We start with a relatively naive approach:

**[Preference Trajectory Analysis](/preference-trajectories/)**  
Using LLMs as experimental proxies to map how preferences evolve through high-dimensional state space as framing changes. Applying dynamical systems theory and differential geometry to understand the mathematical structure of preference instability. [Read More](/preference-trajectories/)

Rather than studying humans directly (expensive, slow, noisy), I'm using Large Language Models as "cognitive simulators" that exhibit human-like biases and inconsistencies. This lets me run thousands of controlled experiments rapidly, then validate findings against psychological literature. The choice of mathematics is not an accident; it's been posited that behavioral states can be modeled as quantum states [1], but in order to actually obtain "behavioral data" we need very fine-tuned prompting. Of course, the underlying mathematical methodology will be rooted in optimization. The link between these fields is nontrivial and, quite possibly, non-existent. So join me on this exploration into the unknown! 

## Current Plan for this Blog 

This preference work is the opening move in a planned series exploring mathematical frameworks for different aspects of human "irrationality":

- **Aversions & Loss Psychology** - How avoidance differs from approach
- **Temporal Inconsistency** - Present vs. future preference conflicts
- **Social Influence Dynamics** - Preference cascades and conformity mathematics
- **Meta-Preferences** - Preferences about having preferences

Each investigation will build mathematical sophistication while revealing new aspects of human decision-making complexity. The long-term goal: develop optimization theory that works _with_ human unpredictability rather than against it.

## Why This Matters

Every major system failure traces back to the same problem: we build mathematical models assuming rational actors, then act shocked when humans behave like... humans. Whether it's market crashes, product flops, or organizational disasters, the math breaks down when it encounters actual human psychology.

But what if we could develop optimization frameworks designed from the ground up to handle human inconsistency? That's the vision driving this work.

_The tools may be mathematical, but the questions are deeply human. How do we make decisions when we don't know what we want? How do preferences shift as we learn more about our options? Can we model the beautiful, frustrating complexity of human choice? How do we optimize human behavior?_

_Let's find out._
