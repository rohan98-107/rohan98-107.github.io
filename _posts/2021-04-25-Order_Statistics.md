This will be my first technical post. Part of the reason I made this blog was to further explore any interesting relationships between my current thesis research and other topics in mathematical OR. One such concept that I felt made the cut was that of *Order Statistics*.

For a collection of random variables (RVs) $$(X_j)_{j=1}^n$$ , the first order statistic is defined as: $$\displaystyle X_{(1)} = \min(X_1, X_2, \hdots, X_n)$$.
